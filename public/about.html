  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Sjúrður, a software engineer with a passion for low-level programming and system development. 
  I love working with languages like C, C++, and Rust, diving deep into the mechanics of how things work under the hood. 
  Lately, I’ve been expanding my skill set into web development, exploring modern frameworks and technologies 
  to build dynamic and scalable applications.</p>

<p>But my interests aren’t just limited to code. Outside of the digital world, I dedicate my time to something equally 
  challenging and rewarding—I’m a volunteer rescue boat crew member and a firefighter. Whether it’s solving complex 
  programming problems or responding to emergency situations, I thrive in high-pressure environments 
  where quick thinking and teamwork make all the difference.</p>

<p>This space is where I share my projects, thoughts, and experiences from both worlds—technology and rescue work. 
  Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about programming, web development, or even emergency response!</p>
